description: "Chronological record of engineering tasks solved in the NeqSim repo. Searchable by keywords, task type, and equipment. Provides memory across sessions."

# Task Log

> **Purpose:** Persistent memory across sessions. Every solved task gets an entry here
> so future sessions can find prior solutions instead of starting from scratch.
>
> **How to use:** Search this file for keywords before starting a new task.
> If a similar task was solved before, start from that solution.

## Entry Format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — Short task title
**Type:** A (Property) | B (Process) | C (PVT) | D (Standards) | E (Feature) | F (Design)
**Keywords:** comma, separated, search, terms
**Solution:** Where the code lives (test file, notebook, source file)
**Notes:** Key decisions, gotchas, or results worth remembering

### 2025-07-17 — CNG tank temperature estimation improvements and Jupyter notebooks
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** CNG, tank, filling, emptying, depressurization, VU-flash, heat transfer, Churchill-Chu, Gnielinski, natural convection, mixed convection, transient wall, VesselDepressurization, temperature estimation, MDMT
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/tank/VesselDepressurization.java`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_FillingSimulation.ipynb`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_EmptyingSimulation.ipynb`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_GasProperties_HTC.ipynb`
**Notes:**
- 6 Java improvements to VesselDepressurization: fixed flow rate filling, filling energy balance with VU-flash, external HTC (Churchill-Chu + Gnielinski), target pressure control, hemispheric geometry, mole-scaling fix
- Bug fixes: (1) Cp*1000 in 3 HTC methods inflated coefficients 1000x, (2) OptimizedVUflash static variables contaminating between calls, (3) temperature guards for non-physical VU-flash results
- Critical finding: VU-flash convergence fails when dt switches from 10s to 60s at low pressure — use constant dt=10s
- Filling: 20→250 bar in 52 hr, gas T: 15→30°C, no liquid dropout
- Emptying: 250→20 bar in 57 hr, min gas T: -0.4°C, MDMT check passed (-46°C margin)
- Ambient sensitivity: even at -20°C ambient, min wall T = -34.4°C (above MDMT)
- HT model comparison: ADIABATIC=-94°C, CALCULATED=+9°C, TRANSIENT_WALL=-0.4°C
- Cp notebook bug: getMolarMass() returns kg/mol, so * 1000 in Cp conversion was wrong (same root cause as Java Cp*1000 bug)
- 41 unit tests passing, devtools workflow used (target/classes, no JAR packaging)

### 2026-03-01 — Well mechanical design and cost estimation system
**Type:** F (Design)
**Keywords:** well, subsea, casing, tubing, mechanical design, NORSOK D-010, API 5CT, cost estimation, drilling, completion, barrier verification, WellMechanicalDesign, WellDesignCalculator, WellCostEstimator
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/process/mechanicaldesign/subsea/WellMechanicalDesign.java`, `WellDesignCalculator.java`, `WellCostEstimator.java`, `src/test/java/.../WellMechanicalDesignTest.java`
**Notes:**
- SubseaWell was the only subsea equipment type WITHOUT a mechanical design class
- Added WellType, CompletionType, RigType enums to SubseaWell
- Three-layer pattern: SubseaWell → WellMechanicalDesign → WellDesignCalculator + WellCostEstimator
- Casing design: burst/collapse/tension per API Bull 5C3, supports 14 casing grades (H40 through 25Cr)
- Well barrier verification per NORSOK D-010 two-barrier principle
- Cost estimation with regional factors (Norway 1.35x, GOM 1.0x, etc.)
- Wired into FieldDevelopmentCostEstimator via setWellParameters()
- CSV data files: WellCostData.csv, CasingProperties.csv
- 21 tests all passing
- Documentation: docs/process/well_mechanical_design.md

### 2026-03-01 — Task log and context system created
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** context, documentation, workflow, onboarding, task-solving
**Solution:** `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/development/TASK_SOLVING_GUIDE.md`, `docs/development/TASK_LOG.md`
**Notes:** Created a 3-file context system to make repo-based task solving faster:
- `CONTEXT.md` — 60-second orientation (repo map, patterns, constraints)
- `TASK_SOLVING_GUIDE.md` — workflow for classifying and solving tasks
- `TASK_LOG.md` — this file, persistent memory across sessions
