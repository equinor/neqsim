### 2026-06-17 — Turboexpander off-design state-of-the-art enhancements (P1–P6)
**Type:** E (Feature) / B (Process)
**Keywords:** turboexpander, expander performance map, ExpanderChartKhader, composition-aware, IGV control, inlet guide vanes, efficiency penalty curve, anti-surge controller, runTransient, recycle valve, seal-gas envelope, axial thrust, thrust bearing, critical speed, operating envelope, hydrate margin, OEM map ingestion, Khader 2015, Atlas Copco Rotoflow
**Solution:** New classes `src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/expander/ExpanderChartKhader.java` (P1), `TurboExpanderMapIngestion.java` (P4), `TurboExpanderOperatingEnvelope.java` (P6), `src/main/java/neqsim/process/controllerdevice/AntiSurgeController.java` (P3), `src/main/java/neqsim/process/mechanicaldesign/expander/TurboExpanderSealGasEnvelope.java` (P5); modified `TurboExpanderCompressor.java` (P1+P2 — chart hook, IGV control mode + efficiency penalty curve). Tests: `src/test/java/neqsim/process/equipment/expander/TurboExpanderEnhancementsTest.java` (6 tests), `src/test/java/neqsim/process/controllerdevice/AntiSurgeControllerTest.java` (2 tests) — all 8 pass.
**Notes:** Implemented the 6 prioritized NIPs from the Oseberg review to bring the expander side to compressor-side fidelity. **P1** — `ExpanderChartKhader` is a composition-aware 2-D map η_s,head = f(U/C, IGV) modeled on `CompressorChartKhader2015`: head normalized by reference-fluid sound speed² then scaled by the actual process-fluid cs², bilinear interpolation over U/C and IGV with edge clamping. `TurboExpanderCompressor.computeExpanderEfficiency()` uses the chart when defined, else falls back to the parabolic U/C × design-eff law. **P2** — IGV promoted to a controllable DOF: `setIgvControlMode(true)` makes `IGVopening` a true input (model no longer recomputes it), coupled to `setIgvEfficiencyPenaltyCurve()` (η loss vs opening). **P3** — `AntiSurgeController extends ControllerDeviceBaseClass`, reads `Compressor.getDistanceToSurge()`, reverse-acting PI with anti-windup drives a recycle `ThrottlingValve` via `setPercentValveOpening()` in `runTransient`. **P4** — `TurboExpanderMapIngestion` builds auditable `CompressorChartKhader2015` + `ExpanderChartKhader` from digitized OEM anchor points (ACR00162 design + Case B) with `validateExpanderChart(tolerance)`. **P5** — `TurboExpanderSealGasEnvelope` checks axial thrust vs ΔP and thrust-bearing limit, seal-gas heater duty (FE-25832 = 28 kW, 30 °C set-point), and critical-speed margin; converts thermodynamic feasibility into mechanical allowability. **P6** — `TurboExpanderOperatingEnvelope` sweeps inlet-P × flow producing feasibility/surge-margin/cold-end-T/hydrate-margin grids with `toJson()`. GOTCHA: P3 controller fully overrides `runTransient` (controlled var comes directly from the compressor, not a transmitter); P5 made a standalone companion class rather than editing the 1000-line `TurboExpanderCompressorMechanicalDesign`. All Java 8 compatible; JavaDoc complete; validated `.\mvnw.cmd test` → 8/8 pass.

### 2026-06-17 — Oseberg OSD turboexpander future-operation review (NeqSim capability assessment)
**Type:** B (Process) / G (Workflow)
**Keywords:** Oseberg, OSD, turboexpander, Atlas Copco Rotoflow 16R101A4210, ACR00162, brake compressor, off-design, cold-end validation, hydrate margin, turndown, capability assessment, NIP, state of the art, future operation review
**Solution:** `task_solve/2026-06-17_oseberg_osd_turboexpander_future_operation_review/` — step1 docs (`task_spec.md`, `notes.md`, `capability_assessment.md`, `neqsim_improvements.md` with 6 NIPs), step2 notebook `step2_analysis/oseberg_turboexpander_review.ipynb` (3 figures, results.json)
**Notes:** Answered the user's two questions: (1) **Yes, NeqSim can do a detailed technical review of future operation** for the Atlas Copco Rotoflow 16R101A4210 single-shaft turboexpander/brake-compressor (Oseberg "D"). The notebook anchors to the certified design (60.4→44.7 bara, 3.9→−11.56 °C, 6550 rpm) and colder Case B (59.45→36.5 bara, −19.84→−41.38 °C, 8160 rpm) points. **Machine-specific cold-end validation:** at nominal η_s=0.85 the model reproduces certified expander outlet T within ~2–3 °C (design −14.68 vs −11.56; Case B −43.18 vs −41.38), with the 0.80–0.90 band bracketing certified — the small offset tracks the assumed gas (MW 18.84 vs certified 19.1–19.5), not the model. Integrated single-shaft `MapTurboExpanderCompressor` (BALANCED_SPEED) gives self-balancing speed, surge distance (1.21), turndown limit (~57 bara on the illustrative map), and SRK-CPA cold-end hydrate margins (design −26.8 °C, Case B −55.1 °C below hydrate-form T → dehydration/dry-seal-gas integrity-critical). (2) **6 prioritized improvements to reach state of the art** (`neqsim_improvements.md`): NIP-1 true expander efficiency map η=f(U/C,%N,IGV) (fixes solver instability <75% load); NIP-2 IGV as controllable input + efficiency-penalty curve; NIP-3 dynamic anti-surge control in runTransient; NIP-4 mechanical/thrust/seal-gas envelope; NIP-5 OEM map ingestion; NIP-6 multi-variable feasibility/surge/hydrate contour envelope. **Scope caveat:** OEM performance curves are scanned images sized far larger than the illustrative composition-aware compressor map, so integrated speed/surge numbers are methodological; the flow-independent cold-end validation is machine-specific. GOTCHA: back-calculating expander η from a small ΔT window is over-sensitive to assumed composition (gave spurious 0.54) — report model-vs-certified ΔT at nominal η instead. Notebook validated end-to-end via nbconvert (160 KB).

### 2026-06-17 — IGV schedule + anti-surge recycle curve fits; MapTurboExpanderCompressor.toJson/feasibility
**Type:** E (Feature) / B (Process)
**Keywords:** turboexpander, IGV, inlet guide vanes, anti-surge recycle, hot-gas bypass, turndown, U/C ratio, curve fit, OperatingStatus, toJson, Oseberg, Atlas Copco Rotoflow, EC-OD, off-design
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/expander/MapTurboExpanderCompressor.java` (added `OperatingStatus` enum, `getOperatingStatus()`, `isFeasible()`, `toMap()`, `toJson()`), `src/test/java/.../MapTurboExpanderCompressorTest.java` (added `testInfeasibleTurndownPath`, `testToJsonReportsKeyResults` — 4 tests pass), `examples/notebooks/ExpanderCompressorModelComparison.ipynb` (new Section 11: IGV schedule + recycle curve fits)
**Notes:** Closed reporting gaps on the map-based machine: `toJson()`/`toMap()` now emit shaft speed, operating status (BALANCED / UNDER_POWER_SURGE / OVER_POWER_MAX_SPEED), feasibility, and power-balance residual. Notebook Section 11 adds two fitted off-design correlations for the **Oseberg "D" Atlas Copco Rotoflow 16R101A4210** machine (design 60.4→44.7 bara, 6550 rpm; Case B 59.45→36.5 bara, 8160 rpm): (1) **IGV schedule** — sweeping expander throughput 100→75% shows `IGVopening` falls linearly with flow (0.258→0.200), confirming nozzle continuity $A\propto Q/C$; U/C and η hold near optimum to ~80% load then roll off. NOTE: curve-fit `TurboExpanderCompressor` speed solver hits its bounds (1000/9000 rpm) below ~75% load → restrict sweeps to the valid range. (2) **Recycle correlation** — make-up power below the turndown limit (55.75 bara) fitted as `makeup% = a·exp(b·ΔP)`. Both grounded in Bloch & Soares (2001) and the TAMU *Tutorial on Cryogenic Turboexpanders*. Validated end-to-end via nbconvert (495 KB).

### 2026-04-09 — MapTurboExpanderCompressor + all expander/compressor model comparison
**Type:** E (Feature) / B (Process)
**Keywords:** turboexpander, expander-compressor, companding, EC-OD, River City Engineering, Mafi-Trench, single shaft, power balance, compressor map, CompressorChartKhader2015, off-design
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/expander/MapTurboExpanderCompressor.java` (new map-based single-shaft machine), `src/test/java/neqsim/process/equipment/expander/MapTurboExpanderCompressorTest.java`, `examples/notebooks/ExpanderCompressorModelComparison.ipynb` (compares Expander, Compressor+map, CompressorChartKhader2015, TurboExpanderCompressor, MapTurboExpanderCompressor)
**Notes:** New `MapTurboExpanderCompressor` couples a real `Expander` + `Compressor` on a common shaft and solves shaft speed by power balance (BALANCED_SPEED mode) reusing the compressor performance map — the open analogue of EC-OD's rigorous map method, complementing the existing curve-fit/IGV `TurboExpanderCompressor`. Notebook gotchas: (1) compressor map flow range must match the feed's actual inlet volumetric flow (130000 kg/hr ≈ 3525 m³/hr lands mid-map; 423000 kg/hr was far off-map and gave negative head/efficiency); (2) `CompressorChartKhader2015.setCurves` requires strictly increasing flow per speed line — a duplicate point (3591.5, 3591.5) threw NonMonotonicSequenceException. Both integrated models agree closely (discharge 52.4 vs 52.1 bara, shaft power balanced). Notebook also includes a **turndown / feasibility analysis**: as expander inlet pressure falls, recovered power drops ~linearly (isentropic enthalpy-drop law) while the brake-compressor min-speed power demand stays ~constant (1.019 MW); their crossover gives the minimum feasible inlet pressure (~55.5 bara, expansion ratio ≈1.33). Below it the shaft pegs at min map speed with negative power-balance residual → compressor surge (EC-OD recycle line). Related to Bloch & Soares (2001), Agahi & Ershaghi, Whitfield & Baines (U/C≈0.7). Notebook validated end-to-end via nbconvert.

### 2026-03-10 — Process architecture improvements: stream introspection, named controllers, connections, unified elements
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** architecture, ProcessElementInterface, ProcessConnection, MultiPortEquipment, getInletStreams, getOutletStreams, controller map, named controllers, runTransient, controller scan, getAllElements, DEXPI, topology, stream introspection, connections
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/ProcessElementInterface.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/MultiPortEquipment.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/ProcessConnection.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/ProcessEquipmentInterface.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/ProcessEquipmentBaseClass.java, src/test/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/ProcessArchitectureTest.java
**Notes:** Six backward-compatible architecture improvements motivated by DEXPI integration friction. (1) Stream introspection: `getInletStreams()`/`getOutletStreams()` on ProcessEquipmentInterface with default empty lists; overridden in TwoPortEquipment, Separator, ThreePhaseSeparator, Mixer, Splitter — all return unmodifiable lists. (2) Named controller map: `addController(tag, ctrl)`, `getController(tag)`, `getControllers()` on ProcessEquipmentBaseClass alongside legacy `setController()`. (3) ProcessElementInterface: unified marker extending NamedInterface + Serializable; adopted by ProcessEquipmentInterface, MeasurementDeviceInterface, ControllerDeviceInterface. (4) Controller scan in runTransient: explicit loop over system-level controllerDevices after equipment loop. (5) ProcessConnection: typed connection metadata (MATERIAL/ENERGY/SIGNAL) with `ProcessSystem.connect()` and `getConnections()`. (6) MultiPortEquipment: abstract base class for multi-inlet/outlet equipment. 173 tests passing (14 architecture + 42 DEXPI + 117 core process). Documentation updated in process_system.md, extending_process_equipment.md, controllers.md, dynamic_simulation_guide.md, CODE_PATTERNS.md, CONTEXT.md.

### 2026-03-10 — DEXPI review: multi-outlet nozzles, stream identity matching, namespace support
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** DEXPI, multi-outlet, nozzle, separator, stream identity, connection, pass-through, namespace, absorber, stripper, column subtype, instrument rename, DexpiStreamUtils, DexpiXmlWriter, DexpiEquipmentFactory, DexpiSimulationBuilder
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiStreamUtils.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiXmlWriter.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiEquipmentFactory.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiSimulationBuilder.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiXmlReader.java
**Notes:** Implemented all 11 recommendations from DEXPI code review. (1) DexpiStreamUtils: shared outlet-stream resolution utility replacing duplicated reflection-based code. (2) Reflection removal: outlet access via TwoPortEquipment/Separator casts instead of Method.invoke. (3) Multi-outlet nozzles: writer creates 2 outlet nozzles for Separator, 3 for ThreePhaseSeparator. (4) Stream identity matching: connections built by matching System.identityHashCode of inlet/outlet streams; registerPassThroughStreams handles wrapper Streams that delegate getFluid(). (5) Column subtype: DexpiEquipmentFactory detects "absorb"/"strip" in DEXPI class to configure condenser/reboiler flags. (6) Namespace-aware parsing: setNamespaceAware(boolean) on builder and reader. (7) Instrument renaming: applyAutoInstrumentation now calls setName() on transmitters and controllers (ControllerDeviceBaseClass cast). 4 new tests (cyclic topology, multi-outlet separator, 2 round-trip profile); 68 tests total, all passing.

### 2026-03-10 — DEXPI round-trip export, cycle detection, and column support
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** DEXPI, P&ID, round-trip, export, XML writer, connection, nozzle, reverse mapping, cycle detection, distillation column, simulation results, instrument wiring, DexpiXmlWriter, DexpiXmlWriterTest
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiXmlWriter.java, src/test/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiXmlWriterTest.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiTopologyResolver.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiEquipmentFactory.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiSimulationBuilder.java
**Notes:** Completed 7 round-trip (DEXPI↔NeqSim) improvements. DexpiXmlWriter gains Connection/Nozzle export (buildConnections, appendNozzle, appendConnectionSystem), native equipment reverse mapping (reverseMapComponentClass maps Separator→VesselForStorage, Compressor→CompressorUnit, etc.), and simulation results export (appendSimulationResults writes temperature/pressure/flow as GenericAttributes). DexpiTopologyResolver gains hasCycle() via DFS-based detection. DexpiEquipmentFactory gains createColumn() for DistillationColumn instantiation with NumberOfTrays and FeedTray sizing attributes. DexpiSimulationBuilder instrument tag wiring replaced setName() calls with logging-based tag association (ControllerDeviceInterface/MeasurementDeviceInterface lack setName). Fixed instanceof ordering bug: Cooler extends Heater, so Cooler must be checked before Heater in reverseMapComponentClass. 15 new tests (11 in DexpiXmlWriterTest, 2 cycle-detection, 2 column-creation); 64 tests total, all passing.

### 2026-03-10 — DEXPI topology resolver, equipment factory, and simulation builder
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** DEXPI, P&ID, topology, nozzle, connection, equipment factory, simulation builder, mapping loader, sizing, DexpiTopologyResolver, DexpiEquipmentFactory, DexpiSimulationBuilder, DexpiMappingLoader, GenericAttribute, Kahn, topological sort
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiTopologyResolver.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiEquipmentFactory.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiSimulationBuilder.java, src/main/java/neqsim/process/processmodel/dexpi/DexpiMappingLoader.java
**Notes:** Resolved 7 critical gaps in DEXPI implementation. DexpiTopologyResolver parses Nozzle/Connection/Equipment XML elements into a directed graph, collapses inline piping components (valves, reducers) to equipment-level edges, and produces topological ordering via Kahn's algorithm. DexpiEquipmentFactory converts DexpiProcessUnit placeholders to real NeqSim equipment (Separator, Compressor, Pump, HeatExchanger, Heater, Cooler, Valve, Expander, Mixer, Splitter) with sizing attributes applied. DexpiSimulationBuilder is a fluent builder API: setFluidTemplate/setFeedPressure/setFeedTemperature/setFeedFlowRate/setAutoInstrument → build() returns runnable ProcessSystem. DexpiMappingLoader provides thread-safe cached loading of .properties mapping files from classpath. DexpiMetadata expanded with 10 sizing constants. DexpiProcessUnit gains sizingAttributes map and dexpiId. Equipment mapping expanded from ~30 to ~65 entries; piping component mapping from ~15 to ~28. 49 tests across 7 test classes (all passing).

### 2026-03-10 — DynamicProcessHelper utility for steady-state to dynamic conversion
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** dynamic, transient, simulation, DynamicProcessHelper, transmitter, PID, controller, instrument, auto-instrument, pressure, level, flow, temperature, control loop, PC, LC, FC, TC, runTransient, setCalculateSteadyState
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/util/DynamicProcessHelper.java, src/test/java/neqsim/process/util/DynamicProcessHelperTest.java, docs/process/dynamic-simulation.md
**Notes:** Utility that converts a sized steady-state ProcessSystem into a dynamic simulation. Auto-creates transmitters (PT, LT, TT) and PID controllers (PC, LC, WLC) by scanning equipment and matching stream identity to downstream valves. Handles Separator, ThreePhaseSeparator, Compressor, Heater, Cooler. Convenience methods for addFlowController() and addTemperatureController(). Default PID tuning with per-type customization. Key gotcha: transmitters implement MeasurementDeviceInterface (NOT ProcessEquipmentInterface), so ProcessSystem.add(MeasurementDeviceInterface) must be used. 10 tests passing.

### 2026-03-10 — Implement InstrumentDesign framework
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** instrument, design, ISA, SIL, I/O, DCS, SIS, instrumentation, ISA-5.1, IEC 61508, IEC 61511, API 670, safety, compressor, separator, heat exchanger, pipeline, valve, tag number, cabinet sizing, cost estimation
**Solution:** src/main/java/neqsim/process/instrumentdesign/
**Notes:** Mirrors ElectricalDesign pattern. Base class InstrumentDesign with InstrumentSpecification (ISA-5.1 data sheets) and InstrumentList (I/O counting, cost aggregation, tag generation). Equipment-specific designs for separator (PT×2 + PSH + TT + LT×2 + LSH + LSLL + ZT×2; three-phase adds interface LT + water ZT), compressor (API 617/670 suite: ~18 instruments including VT×4 vibration probes, anti-surge FT/FCV, bearing TTs, lube oil PT/PSLL), heat exchanger (auto-detects shell-and-tube/air cooler/electric heater), pipeline (pig detection ZS×2, leak detection PSLL, metering FT), and valve (ZT + ZC; safety valves add XV + ZSO/ZSC). System-level SystemInstrumentDesign aggregates across ProcessSystem and sizes DCS (~16 ch/card, ~16 cards/cab), SIS (~8 ch/card, ~8 cards/cab), and marshalling cabinets. Integrated via ProcessEquipmentInterface.getInstrumentDesign() and ProcessSystem.getSystemInstrumentDesign(). 12 tests passing.

### 2026-03-09 — H₂S/CO₂ Distribution Between Gas, Oil, Water — EOS Model Comparison
**Type:** A (Property)
**Keywords:** H2S, CO2, acid gas, distribution, solubility, water, oil, gas, produced water, brine, salinity, SRK, PR, CPA, electrolyte CPA, chemical reactions, three-phase, salting-out, pH, NACE MR0175, sour service, model selection, decision matrix, Duan Sun, Carroll Mather, Soreide Whitson, Monte Carlo, benchmark
**Solution:** task_solve/2026-03-09_h2s_co2_distribution_gas_oil_water_produced_water_eos_comparison/
**Notes:** Systematic comparison of 4 EOS models (SRK, PR, SRK-CPA, Electrolyte-CPA) across 10 scenarios for acid gas partitioning. Critical findings: (1) SRK/PR give near-zero CO₂ solubility in water — unsuitable for acid gas-water systems; (2) Only Electrolyte-CPA correctly predicts three phases (gas/oil/aqueous); (3) chemicalReactionInit() is mandatory for pH, salting-out, and ionic speciation; (4) H₂S shows retrograde solubility (max 60-70°C); (5) Water content is dominant sensitivity (1.42% swing in Monte Carlo). Benchmark: 5/5 tests PASS (13.8-25.0% deviation vs Duan & Sun 2003, Carroll & Mather 1991). Monte Carlo N=300: H₂S aqueous P10/P50/P90 = 0.51/0.92/1.35%. Decision matrix maps 12 applications to recommended models. 6 NIPs proposed (acid gas report, produced water builder, pH calculator, salting-out DB, compliance checker, model advisor).

### 2026-03-09 — CO2 Corrosion Analyzer with Electrolyte CPA pH
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** corrosion, CO2, pH, electrolyte CPA, de Waard-Milliams, NORSOK M-506, chemical reaction equilibrium, H3O+, carbonic acid, HCO3-, CCS, pipeline, corrosion rate, scale, FeCO3, inhibitor, brine, NaCl, severity, aqueous speciation
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/pvtsimulation/flowassurance/CO2CorrosionAnalyzer.java`, `src/test/java/neqsim/pvtsimulation/flowassurance/CO2CorrosionAnalyzerTest.java`, `examples/notebooks/CO2_Corrosion_Analysis_ElectrolyteCPA.ipynb`
**Notes:** Facade class coupling electrolyte CPA EOS (SystemElectrolyteCPAstatoil) with de Waard-Milliams corrosion model and ScalePredictionCalculator. Key insight: must call `chemicalReactionInit()` → `createDatabase(true)` → `setMixingRule(10)` → `init(0)` to enable aqueous chemical equilibrium (CO2 + 2H2O → HCO3- + H3O+). Without this, pH returns 7.0 (no H3O+ component). The analyzer auto-creates the electrolyte system, runs flash with chemical reactions, extracts rigorous pH from H3O+ activity, and feeds it into the corrosion model. Supports temperature/pressure sweeps, brine (Na+/Cl-), inhibitor efficiency, and JSON reporting. 12/12 tests passing.

### 2026-03-09 — Water Solubility in Gas and Liquid CO2 Phase Behaviour
**Type:** A (Property)
**Keywords:** water, solubility, CO2, CPA, SRK, PR, equation of state, phase equilibrium, CCS, carbon capture, dehydration, pipeline, gas phase, liquid phase, supercritical, mutual solubility, Wiebe, Gaddy, Bamberger, Spycher, King, Song, Kobayashi, benchmark, validation, ISO 27913, ppmv, water content
**Solution:** task_solve/2026-03-09_water_solubility_in_gas_and_liquid_co2_phase_behaviour/
**Notes:** Investigated water solubility in CO2 across gas, liquid, and supercritical conditions (5-200 bar, 10-80 C) using CPA EOS (SystemSrkCPAstatoil, mixing rule 10). Key findings: gas-phase water content decreases with pressure (Raoult's law dilution), liquid CO2 has low solubility (1000-3000 ppmv), characteristic minimum at CO2 saturation pressure. Benchmark: 9/13 points within 30% tolerance, mean error 25.2%. CPA under-predicts at 60 C (40-50% error vs Bamberger data). CPA outperforms SRK/PR at high pressures. Monte Carlo (N=300): P10/P50/P90 = 2986/3616/4253 ppmv for CCS conditions — dehydration always required (100% exceed 500 ppmv ISO limit). Tornado: EOS model uncertainty dominates (1729 ppmv swing), then pressure (1068), then temperature (945). Overall risk: Medium (2 high, 3 medium, 2 low).

### 2026-03-09 — Sulfur Deposition Analysis
**Type:** B (Process)
**Keywords:** sulfur, S8, deposition, desublimation, Joule-Thomson, JT cooling, backflow, letdown, valve, H2S, Draupner, pressure reduction, solid flash, GibbsReactor, SulfurDepositionAnalyser, preheating, mitigation
**Solution:** task_solve/2026-03-09_draupner_backflow_letdown_sulfur_deposition_analysis/
**Notes:** Analysed elemental sulfur deposition in a backflow letdown system (70→15 bara). JT cooling gives ~-20°C outlet (JT coeff 0.46-0.58 K/bar). 100% of Monte Carlo scenarios (N=300) produce solid S8. Primary mechanism is desublimation, not chemical reaction. Air ingress (O2) contributes via H2S oxidation at Gibbs equilibrium. Preheating helps but S8 solid persists even at 100°C preheat with >0.01 ppb S8 feed. Used SRK EOS, ThrottlingValve, TPSolidflash, GibbsReactor, SulfurDepositionAnalyser. 9/9 benchmarks PASS (JT coefficients within 15%, S8 solubility within literature order-of-magnitude). Overall risk: High (5 high, 4 medium, 1 low risks).

### 2026-03-08 — NeqSim-based Monte Carlo uncertainty and risk evaluation for NPV
**Type:** G (Workflow)
**Keywords:** uncertainty, Monte Carlo, risk, NPV, GIP, resource estimate, tornado, sensitivity, ISO 31000, risk matrix, NeqSim simulation, SRK EOS, SimpleReservoir, Beggs & Brill, SURFCostEstimator, triangular distribution, P10 P50 P90, field development
**Solution:** `task_solve/2026-03-07_npv_calculation_of_field_development_subsea_tieback/step2_analysis/03_uncertainty_risk_analysis.ipynb`, `step3_report/generate_report.py` (Sections 9-10)

### 2026-03-04 — Sulfur deposition and corrosion analysis system
**Type:** E (Feature)

### 2025-07-17 — CNG tank temperature estimation improvements and Jupyter notebooks
**Type:** E (Feature)
**Keywords:** CNG, tank, filling, emptying, depressurization, VU-flash, heat transfer, Churchill-Chu, Gnielinski, natural convection, mixed convection, transient wall, VesselDepressurization, temperature estimation, MDMT
**Solution:** `src/main/java/neqsim/process/equipment/tank/VesselDepressurization.java`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_FillingSimulation.ipynb`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_EmptyingSimulation.ipynb`, `examples/CNGtankmodelling/CNG_GasProperties_HTC.ipynb`
**Notes:**
- 6 Java improvements to VesselDepressurization: fixed flow rate filling, filling energy balance with VU-flash, external HTC (Churchill-Chu + Gnielinski), target pressure control, hemispheric geometry, mole-scaling fix
- Bug fixes: (1) Cp*1000 in 3 HTC methods inflated coefficients 1000x, (2) OptimizedVUflash static variables contaminating between calls, (3) temperature guards for non-physical VU-flash results
- Critical finding: VU-flash convergence fails when dt switches from 10s to 60s at low pressure — use constant dt=10s
- Filling: 20→250 bar in 52 hr, gas T: 15→30°C, no liquid dropout
- Emptying: 250→20 bar in 57 hr, min gas T: -0.4°C, MDMT check passed (-46°C margin)
- Ambient sensitivity: even at -20°C ambient, min wall T = -34.4°C (above MDMT)
- HT model comparison: ADIABATIC=-94°C, CALCULATED=+9°C, TRANSIENT_WALL=-0.4°C
- Cp notebook bug: getMolarMass() returns kg/mol, so * 1000 in Cp conversion was wrong (same root cause as Java Cp*1000 bug)
- 41 unit tests passing, devtools workflow used (target/classes, no JAR packaging)
