# Thermodynamic Documentation Set

This folder collects topic-specific documentation for using NeqSim's thermodynamic, PVT, and physical property capabilities. Each page is intended to be self-contained while pointing to related guides so you can jump directly to the workflows you need.

## Contents
- [Mathematical Models](mathematical_models.md): Equations of state, activity-coefficient formulations, and transport correlations available in NeqSim.
- [Thermodynamic Workflows](thermodynamic_workflows.md): How to set up systems, select models, and perform common equilibrium calculations.
- [PVT and Fluid Characterization](pvt_fluid_characterization.md): Building realistic fluid descriptions, including heavy-end handling and lab-data reconciliation.
- [Thermodynamic Operations](thermodynamic_operations.md): Flash calculations, phase envelopes, and other process-centric operations.
- [Physical Properties](physical_properties.md): Density, viscosity, surface tension, and transport-property calculations.
- [GERG-2008 and EOS-CG](gerg2008_eoscg.md): Detailed guide to the reference equations of state for natural gas and CCS applications.

Each document favors short, reproducible code snippets using the Java API so the same ideas transfer to other supported languages (Python/Matlab) with minor syntax changes.
