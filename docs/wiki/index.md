NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimating fluid properties and process design. The library contains models for phase behavior and physical properties of fluids and can easily be extended with new models. Development was initiated at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/even.solbraa).

NeqSim is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). Releases are provided as jar files from GitHub and can be added as a dependency in your own Java projects.
