# MCP published-surface inventory

This inventory records the public MCP protocol surface on campaign issue #3153's Phase 0
baseline. The focused protocol regression in `test_mcp_server.py` obtains every entry through the
running server's standards-conforming list operations; it does not infer publication from a
manually maintained Java method list.

| Surface | Count | Protocol evidence | Authoritative implementation |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Tools | 71 | `tools/list` | `NeqSimTools` MCP annotations |
| Static resources | 7 | `resources/list` | `NeqSimResources` MCP annotations |
| Resource templates | 7 | `resources/templates/list` | `NeqSimResources` MCP annotations |
| Guided prompts | 9 | `prompts/list` | `NeqSimPrompts` MCP annotations |

The tool regression asserts the exact 71-name set grouped by its current trust tier. It also calls
`getCapabilities` and requires `toolCatalogCoverage.complete`, equal published and described tool
counts, and empty missing/undeclared descriptor lists. That reconciles transport publication with
the governance and capability registries without introducing a second MCP-only simulator.

## Resources

| Static resource | Resource template |
| --- | --- |
| `neqsim://components` | `neqsim://components/{name}` |
| `neqsim://data-tables` | `neqsim://materials/{type}` |
| `neqsim://example-catalog` | `neqsim://examples/{category}/{name}` |
| `neqsim://models` | `neqsim://api/{className}` |
| `neqsim://schema-catalog` | `neqsim://schemas/{tool}/{type}` |
| `neqsim://setup-templates` | `neqsim://setup-templates/{id}` |
| `neqsim://standards` | `neqsim://standards/{code}` |

The two columns are independent inventories; rows do not imply a one-to-one relationship.

## Guided prompts

- `biorefinery_analysis`
- `co2_ccs_chain`
- `design_gas_processing`
- `dynamic_simulation`
- `field_development_screening`
- `flow_assurance_screening`
- `pipeline_sizing`
- `pvt_study`
- `teg_dehydration_design`

## Governance and compatibility

The published tools are classified by `IndustrialProfile` as trusted core, engineering advanced,
or experimental, and as advisory, calculation, execution, or platform operations. The supported
deployment profiles are `DESKTOP_ENGINEER`, `STUDY_TEAM`, `DIGITAL_TWIN`, and `ENTERPRISE`.
Publication does not mean that every tool is enabled in every profile or has the same engineering
validation maturity. Call `getCapabilities`, `getBenchmarkTrust`, and `checkToolAccess` before
execution and preserve each calculation's provenance, convergence, validation, assumptions, and
limitations.

This increment changes no tool name, input or output schema, deployment default, thermodynamic
model, process model, or response envelope. Process execution continues to use canonical NeqSim
fluids, streams, `ProcessSystem`, and `ProcessModel` objects.

## Phase 0 stop boundary

This increment freezes the exact transport-facing tools, resources, resource templates, prompts,
deployment-profile names, and tool-capability reconciliation on the tested baseline. It does not
complete the campaign's full Phase 0 inventory. Follow-up work must still inventory individual
schemas, examples, runners, equipment factories, report paths, tests, guides, and known
limitations; reconcile merged foundations #2874, #2875, and #3152 criterion by criterion; add the
four acceptance scales; build the full traceability and discipline-maturity matrices; and record
runtime, memory, payload, convergence, balance-closure, and report-usefulness baselines.

DEXPI/P&ID ingestion remains owned by #2899, dynamics by #2911, flash/stability/performance by
#2937, and merged production-optimization foundations by #2941. This inventory audits existing
publication only and does not implement competing domain functionality.
