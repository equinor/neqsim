/**
 * <p>
 * GTSurfaceTension class. Calculates the surfacetension using the Gradient Theory for mixtures. The
 * method assumes the number of components to be two or more, and that the species set is equal and
 * in the same component order for both phases.
 *
 *
 * Near a fluid-fluid interface, we consider the variation of densities of chemical species,
 * \f$\boldsymbol{n}(z)\f$, as function of position, \f$z\f$, where element \f$k\f$ of the vector
 * \f$\boldsymbol{n}(z)\f$ is the number density of chemical species \f$k\f$ in the mixture. The
 * surface tension is a functional of these densities as explained below.
 *
 * The density profiles near the interface are such that the total Helmholz energy of the system is
 * minimized. The effect of spatial density variations on the Helmholz energy is approximated by a
 * second order Taylor series expansion around the homogeneous fluid of the same composition.
 *
 * \f{equation}{ H=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h \, dz=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( h_0 +
 * \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{n_z}^T \boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{n_z} \right) dz \f}
 *
 * where \f$z\f$ is the spatial coordinate normal to the interface, \f$h_0\f$ is the Helmholz energy
 * of the homogeneous fluid, \f$\boldsymbol{n_z}=\frac{d\boldsymbol{n}}{dz}\f$ is the local density
 * gradient and the matrix of influence parameters \f$\boldsymbol{C}\f$ is the hessian of \f$h\f$
 * with respect to \f$\boldsymbol{n_z}\f$. The influence parameters, \f$\boldsymbol{C}\f$, are
 * normally assumed to be very weak functions of composition, often taken as constant through the
 * interface.
 *
 * The integral is at its minimum when the densities satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation
 *
 * \f{equation}{ \boldsymbol{C}\frac{d^2\boldsymbol{n}}{dz^2} = \mu_0 \left( \boldsymbol{n} \right)
 * - \mu_{\infty} \equiv \Delta \mu \left( \boldsymbol{n} \right) \f}
 *
 * where \f$\mu_0\f$ is the chemical potential of the homogeneous fluid and \f$\mu_{\infty}\f$ is
 * the chemical potential far from the interface (on either side, as the two fluids in contact are
 * assumed to be at equilibrium). Having solved equation for the density profiles,
 * \f$\boldsymbol{n}\left(z\right)\f$, the surface tension can be calculated from: \f{equation}{
 * \sigma = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \boldsymbol{n_z}^T \boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{n_z} \, dz \f}
 *
 * The class uses two different methods based on the value of this.useFullGT. If this variable is
 * set to 0, the surface tension is calculated by solving set of differential algebraic equations
 * using the component density of the highest boiling component in the mixture as the integration
 * variable. This method can only be used if the component density varies monotonically over the
 * interface and the binary interaction parameter for the influence parameter is such that
 *
 * \f{equation}{ \begin{cases} \beta_{ij} = 1 &amp; i = j\\ \beta_{ij} = 0 &amp; i\neq j \end{cases}
 * \f}
 *
 * If these conditions are satisfied, this method is robust and has an acceptable numerical cost
 * (order of seconds for calculation).
 *
 * For the general case, where the monotonicity can not be guaranteed or where \f$\beta_{ij}\f$ is
 * nonzero for \f$i\neq j\f$ the full set of equations for the gradient theory must solved in the
 * domain of the interface thickness. This is significantly more numerically intensive but handles
 * the general case. To calculate the surface tension by this method, set the variable
 * this.useFullGT=1

     * number density varies monotonically through the interface, and that the joint influence
     * parameter \f$c_{ij}\f$ can be described by a quadratic mixing rule, without a binary

     * \f$i\f$, and \f$c_i\f$ and \f$c_{ij}\f$ is the influence and cross-influence parameter. The
     * parameters \f$\xi\f$ must be fitted to the equation of state used.
     *
     * Since the monotonicity of a reference component in general can not be guaranteed, a more
     * general and safer approach would be to solve the system in the spacial domain. This implies
     * solving a boundary value problem with infinite bounds. Although asymptotic arguments leads to
     * simplifications, solving this problem induces a higher numerical cost and complexity.

     * This method solves the surface tension integral using a reference component density as the

     * This method can be used in the general case, including when binary interaction influence
     * parameters \f$\beta_{ij}\f$ are nonzero.
     *
     * On the top level, we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation with Newtons method. Consider solving
     * Equation for \f$\delta\mu\f$ as a Dirichlet problem on a finite domain \f$-L &lt; z &lt; L\f$
     * around the interface. The distance \f$L\f$ should be large enough that it does not disturb
     * the results. The boundary conditions are the homogeneous densities of the two fluids in
     * contact, as calculated by a flash calculation.
     *
     *
     * We approximate the solution on a equi-spaced grid with \f$2^N+1\f$ points where \f$N\f$ is an
     * integer. Using a Finite Difference approximation, the equation for \f$\delta\mu\f$ can then
     * be written as an equation system for the internal grid points, \f$i=2,3,...,2^N\f$:
     *
     * \f{equation}{ \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{F}\left( \mathbf{n}_i \right) \equiv \Delta \mu \left(
     * \mathbf{n}_i \right) - \mathbf{C} \frac{\mathbf{n}_{i-1}
     * -2\mathbf{n}_i+\mathbf{n}_{i+1}}{\Delta z^2}, \quad i=2,3,...,2^N \f}
     *
     * Applying Newtons method on this equation yields the iteration formula for the Newton step:
     * \f{eqnarray}{ \mathbf{J}_i\Delta \mathbf{n}_i - \mathbf{C} \frac{\Delta \mathbf{n}_{i-1}
     * -2\Delta \mathbf{n}_i +\Delta \mathbf{n}_{i+1}}{\Delta z^2} &amp;=&amp; - \mathbf{F}_i\\
     * \mathbf{n}_i &amp;:=&amp; \mathbf{n}_i + \beta \Delta \mathbf{n}_i \f} where
     * \f$\mathbf{J}=\frac{\partial \Delta \mu}{\partial \mathbf{n}_i}\f$ is a Jacobian matrix and
     * \f$\mathbf{F}_i=\mathbf{F}\left( \mathbf{n}_i \right)\f$ is the residual. \f$\beta \le 1\f$
     * is a damping factor. This is a block tridiagonal system that can be solved using a band
     * solver or a sparse matrix solver.
