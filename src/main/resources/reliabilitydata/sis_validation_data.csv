# SIS/SIF Performance Validation Dataset
# Purpose: Validation of Safety Instrumented System calculations against field data
# Format: SIF_ID,Description,TargetSIL,Architecture,TestInterval_months,ProofTestCoverage,SensorFailureRate,LogicFailureRate,FinalElementFailureRate,CalculatedPFD,AchievedSIL,SpuriousTripRate,FieldDemands,FieldSuccesses,Notes
# Failure rates are per hour, PFD is average probability of failure on demand
